# M4Node.js
M4Node.js inside Node.js

## About
M4Node.js abstracts the M4JSAPI library and provides a builder and api of it per session.

The prototype is implemented in typescript and offers the possibility of interacting with the M4JSAPI library with [promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous) (async / await) and [observables](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/observable) (Rxjs)

Purpose:
- Create a user session per instance to work in different contexts with the M4JSAPI library.
- Provide an API that can be easily integrated with Node.js developments.
- Object Oriented Programming Features.
- Back-end Developer.
- TypeScript: Strict typing, Structural typing, Type annotations and Type inference.
- Observable Rxjs: Observer pattern (reactive programming) to write asynchronous code.
- Promises: To write asynchronous code a promise represents a value that may be available now, in the future, or never.
